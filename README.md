My First Website

Hi! I made this a simple & My First Interactive Webpage as my first step into web development.
It has headings, paragraphs, and a button that shows a fun message.
You can open it in any browser and try it yourself.
I made it super easy to read and customize.


A simple, beginner-friendly HTML webpage with a welcoming message, a button that shows a message when clicked, and basic inline styling to make it look clean and attractive.
